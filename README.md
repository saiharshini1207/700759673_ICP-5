# NAIVE BAYES METHOD:

1. This Python code loads the 'glass.csv' dataset using pandas, splits it into features (X) and the target variable (y).
2.  then further splits it into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn. It then instantiates a Naïve Bayes model (specifically Gaussian Naïve Bayes), trains the model on the training data, and makes predictions on the test data.
3.   After that, it calculates the accuracy of the model on the test set using the score method and prints it.
4.    generates a classification report using the classification_report function from scikit-learn, which provides metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
5.Finally, it prints the accuracy.


# SVM METHOD

1. This Python code loads the 'glass.csv' dataset using pandas, splits it into features (X) and the target variable (y), and then further splits it into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.
2. It then instantiates a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with a linear kernel, trains the model on the training data, and makes predictions on the test data.
3. After that, it calculates the accuracy of the model on the test set using the score method and prints.
4. it generates a classification report using the classification_report function from scikit-learn, which provides metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. Finally, it prints the accuracy again to ensure visibility.
